# Connect-four

This is a pretty simple game of connect four built in C++ using some basic
unix networking. 

It's quite rough around the edges, but the main crux of it works for now.

## Build

```
make
```

## Play

Setup server:
```
build/bin/server ip port
```

Connect 2 clients:
```
build/bin/client ip port
```
